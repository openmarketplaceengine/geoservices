/*
Package geocode provides functions that abstract over various 3rd-party
Geocoding APIs, such as OSRM, Google Maps, GraphHopper, MapBox, etc.

Geocoding, or forward geocoding, refers to converting a human-readable string
(such as a postal address) into geographic coordinates. Reverse geocoding is the
opposite.
